# 0x16. C - Simple Shell

This repository contains source code for a simple shell program developed by Ansa and Ayo durng the
0x16. C - Simple Shell project of the ALX SE program.

The program was implemented by completng the following smaller steps:

- 1. Simple shell 0.1: A basic UNIX command line interpreter.
- 2. Simple shell 0.2: Simple shell 0.1 + Handle command lines with arguments.
- 3. Simple shell 0.3: Simple shell 0.2 + Handle the PATH.
- 4. Simple shell 0.4: Simple shell 0.3 + Exit built-in implementation.
- 5. Simple shell 1.0: Simple shell 0.4 + Env built-in implementation.

These were followed by some more complex implementations.
