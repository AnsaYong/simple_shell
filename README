# Simple_shell

## Description:

This Simple Shell project is a basic implementation of a command-line shell in C.
It provides a simple user interface that allows users to execute commands, both built-in
and system commands. This shell supports single commands with and without arguments, making
it capable of handling more complex command sequences. It works in both interactive and
non-interactive mode. The project was created by Ansa and Ayo.

## Key Features:

* Single commands execution
* Execution of commands with arguments
* Built-in commands (e.g., **'exit'**, **'env'**) handling
* Automatic searching for executables in the PATH environment variable
* Display of a prompt to signal readiness for user input
* Handles the End-Of-File (EOF) condition

## Usage:

To use the Simple Shell, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Compile the source code.
3. Run the shell executable.
4. The shell will display a prompt, awaiting your command input.
5. Enter commands and press Enter to execute them.

### Examples:

***Single command execution:***
1. Without argument

_$ ls_

_shell.c  test_ls_2_

2. With argument

_$ /bin/ls -la_
